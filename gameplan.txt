--We are in phase one
	That means that we will have support and guidance during this time.

--What are the requirements?
	-A user must be able to login create the user for now and create the manage in phase two
		Database info:id, username, password 

	-A user must be able to register themselves if they do not have credentials
		Post request to the database for new users
		Ability to create a new account
		The default role for accounts should be employees

	-Employees should be able to submit reimbursment tickets
		Employees can submit a new reimbursement request with amount and description
		Default ticket status should be Pending (once checked by manage should change to confirmed)
		DATABASE: ticket_id, amount, description, employee_id references user, status bool pending/confirmed
	
	-All of this should be in a java console application
		


Create a menu of options for the user to choose
1)Employee
2)Manager
3)Exit 
--Which ever they choose, it should have some kind of display with 
"Welcome to the employee reimbursment portal"
"Welcome to the manager reimbursement approval portal"

--Once they have chosen employee (for the first phase) they should be able to 
--Add their username and password to verify their credentials with a SQL query and if statement

--If credentials are correct the employee should have a menu where they choose what they want to do
	-either submit a reimbursment or exit

--Once they choose reimbursment they should enter a dollar amount, if not dollar amount is entered
	--It should prompt them again to enter a dollar amount

--Once a dollar amount is entered, a description for the reimbursment should be entered. If not there 
--needs to be a prompt that tells them to enter something and that it cannot be left blank

--Once a description is added give the employee their ticket number (aka ticket_id)

--And give them a prompt that asks if they want to log out or submit another reimbursment statement

--When trying to create a new user it must check and see if the username is already in use






Database:


--User should have access to login, view past tickets (join of the user and the matching reimbursement requests)
	and the ability to add a reimbursment request

create table employee (
em_id serial primary key unique,
em_username varchar(20),
em_password varchar(25)
);


create table reimbursement (
ticket_id serial primary key unique,
amount decimal(10,2),
description varchar(100),
status bool,
em_id int references employee
);
--status true will equal pending
--Will need to write an update query to automatically put em_id for reimbursments 
--according to the employee that submitted the request
insert into reimbursement  (amount, description, status, em_id)
values 
(250, 'A new laptop', true, 2),
(75, 'Client lunch', false, 1),
(400, 'Stand up desk', true, 3),
(100, 'AWS Certification', true, 3),
(100, 'OCA Certification', true, 1);




insert into employee (em_username, em_password)
values 
('tdog','12345'),
('jakethesnake', '98765'),
('randyc', '34567'),
('1uigi1','flowerpower'),
('mario2', 'mushroom2');


--All pending request query
select * from reimbursement r 
natural join employee e where status = true;
